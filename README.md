# qb-university
This is a QB-Core script for a university learning and quiz system in FiveM. The script spawns professors as NPCs at specified locations, allowing players to interact with them to enroll in subjects, gather learning materials, and take final exams. The script uses ox_lib for menu interactions and qb-target for targeting NPCs.
